National Fraud Prevention Challenge (NFPC)
Unlocking India’s Next Generation of AI talent in financial security
Hosted by: Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH), a fully owned subsidiary of RBI and IIT
Delhi TRYST
Inviting India’s top academic institutions to participate in the first-of-its-kind AI Hackathon
focused on detecting financial fraud.
About the Challenge
The National Fraud Prevention Challenge (NFPC) is a multi-stage hackathon launched by
RBIH along with IIT Delhi TRYST as a partner to tap into India’s top AI/ML talent and accelerate
innovation on the MuleHunter.ai™ /Digital payments intelligence platform, an advanced AI
system built to detect mule accounts used in financial fraud.
This is not just a competition. It’s a gateway to real-world impact, elite employment
opportunities, and national-level recognition.
Objective: • Enhance and expand AI/ML capabilities for MuleHunter AI
and DPIP.
• Identify top AI/ML talent specializing in fraud analytics, anomaly detection, and
advanced ML research.
• Encourage academic and research institutions to collaborate on real-world financial
security challenges.
• Build a pipeline of interns/employees for RBIH's AI team.
• Promote long-term partnerships with leading universities and research group
Phase 1 Objectives for Participating in Teams
Selected participants will be given a labelled synthetic dataset and are required to:
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Design features (both supervised & unsupervised) to capture anomalous behavior of
mule accounts

=== Page 3 ===
• Demonstrate the ability to think creatively and analytically with real-world fraud
patterns
Who Can Apply?
Each team must consist of 2 to 4 members, and can include:
• 3rd, or 4th Year UG/PG students
• PhD scholars
• Professors or Researchers
• Specialized AI Labs or Campus Fintech Clubs
Top institutions and labs will be considered for long-term partnerships based on quality of
submissions.
Hackathon Tracks in Later Phases:
Participants advancing through further stages will work on:
• Train algorithms
• Graph-based fraud detection
• Concept drift & auto-retraining modules
• Explainable AI (XAI) architecture
• High-performance sequential/transformer models
Prizes & Incentives
• Cash Prizes: ₹5L (1st), ₹3L (2nd), ₹2L (3rd)
• Employment Offer: Selected participants will receive guaranteed roles/internships
at Reserve Bank Innovation Hub to work on the MuleHunter/DPIP platform.

Intellectual Property (IP) & Data Governance
All datasets shared as part of the National Fraud Prevention Challenge (NFPC) are
synthetic and provided strictly for the purpose of this challenge.
Participants are required to adhere to the following:
• The datasets must be used only for NFPC-related submissions
• No attempts should be made to re-identify individuals, entities, or real-world
accounts
• Any code, models, or approaches developed during the challenge will be governed
by RBIH’s hackathon IP framework
RBIH reserves the right to evaluate, adapt, or extend promising ideas or approaches for
internal research or deployment, with appropriate acknowledgment of contributors.
Detailed IP and data usage guidelines will be shared with shortlisted teams.
Ethical AI & Responsible Innovation Guidelines
Participants are expected to follow responsible and ethical AI practices throughout the
challenge. This includes:
• Designing models that minimize bias and unfair outcomes
• Ensuring transparency and explainability wherever feasible
• Avoiding misuse of data or unethical model behavior
• Aligning solutions with regulatory, security, and public-interest considerations
Any violation of ethical AI guidelines or misuse of data may result in disqualification from
the challenge.
Governance & Jury Structure
Submissions will be reviewed and evaluated by a multi-disciplinary jury comprising:
• Members of the RBIH AI and technology teams
• Fraud risk and financial crime domain experts
• External academic or industry experts, as required

=== Page 6 ===
The jury will evaluate submissions based on predefined criteria to ensure fairness,
objectivity, and consistency. The jury’s decisions will be final and binding.
Mentorship & Participant Support
To support participants and ensure clarity, RBIH may provide:
• Orientation or dataset walkthrough sessions
• Limited technical office hours
• Clarification sessions on fraud patterns and problem expectations
These sessions are intended to guide participants and answer queries, without influencing
solution design or evaluation outcomes.
